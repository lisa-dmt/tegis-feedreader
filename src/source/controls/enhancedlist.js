/*
 *		source/controls/enhancedlist.js - Improved VirtualList
 *
 *		This control makes page handling a lot easier. It keeps track
 *		of currently running 'acquirePage' events and automatically refreshes
 *		the list once all are done.
 *		To simplify list updates, the method 'reAcquirePages' can be used. It
 *		avoids flicker as it refreshes the list after all data has been acquired.
